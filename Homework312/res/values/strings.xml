    <string name="example_content">The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has denied Apple\'s bid to trademark the term &quot;iPad Mini,&quot; contending that &quot;mini&quot; is &quot;merely descriptive&quot; of goods or services sold in miniature form. In a letter sent to Apple in January but only recently published, the USPTO reviewer denied Apple\'s application because &quot;the applied-for mark merely describes a feature or characteristic of applicant\'s goods.&quot; Apple can appeal the decision, but to win a reversal the company will need to address the office\'s reasons for denial.
